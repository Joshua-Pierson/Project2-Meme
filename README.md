## ABout Giphy API

The Giphy API is a web-based interface provided by Giphy that allows developers to access and integrate Giphy's vast library of animated GIFs, stickers, and other media into their own applications. It offers endpoints for searching, trending content, translating phrases into GIFs, uploading media, and more. The API returns data in JSON format and supports customizable parameters like search terms, content ratings, and media formats, making it easy to embed and interact with GIF content programmatically.
